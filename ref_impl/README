This directory contains some reference implementations using Theano, that were
used to check my implementation.

These implementations are most likely pretty dumb, mainly because I do not
master Theano (not at all). I just wanted some way to check that I implemented
the backprop equations properly, without computing the gradients numerically.
So don't use them for serious businesses!
